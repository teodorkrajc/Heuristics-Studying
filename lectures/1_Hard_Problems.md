## Organization

**Components:**
- **Lectures:** Tuesday 5+6 (AUD 10), Thursday 3+4 (AUD 2)
- **Instruction:** Tuesday 7+8 (Luna 1.050)
- **Assignments (3x):**
  - First two assignments: each cover 4 lectures
  - Third smaller assignment: covers 3 lectures of final block
- **The Challenge:** Solve an optimization problem for bonus points!
- **Final Exam:** Written

---

## Lectures

- On-campus only  
- Lecture slides are posted after each lecture  
- You may ask questions about lectures/slides on Discord (use the appropriate channel)  
- Lectures mostly cover material in the book + other provided resources  

---

## Instructions

- Work and collaborate on assignments, ask questions, get explanations for earlier assignments  
- Questions can also be asked on Discord  

### Discord

- Place to ask questions about book, lectures, assignments, challenge, etc.  
- Quick responses during instruction hours (may take longer otherwise)  
- Each group gets a **private text and voice channel**  
- Ask questions about your own solutions in your private channel or during instruction  
- Goal: enable more discussion on the server  

---

## Final Grades

- **Assignments:** 50% of total grade  
  - First two assignments: 20% each  
  - Third assignment: 10%  
- **No do-overs!**
- **Challenge:** Optional bonus points  
- **Final Exam:** 50%  
- Exam will be **ANS digital**

## The Challenge

- Can be done **in pairs**  
- Use any heuristic technique  
- **Goal:** Obtain the best score!  
- Initially 5 datasets available; 2 more will be added close to the deadline  
- **2 problems (+ skeleton code):** choose one or both  

**Short Report**
- Length: 1–2 pages  
- Describe your approach + parameter choices  
- Required for bonus points  

**Bonus Points**
- For each problem:  
  - 1st place: +1  
  - 2nd place: +0.5  
  - 3rd place: +0.25  
- Maximum total: +1 bonus point

### Challenge Problem 1 – BEP Assignment

**Context:**  
The Bachelor Computer Science program introduces Bachelor End Projects (BEPs). Supervisors’ workload increases drastically.

**Goal:** Form suitable groups for BEP projects.

**Input:**
- List of projects on certain topics  
- List of students with grades + preferences  
- List of mentors with topic expertise  

**Output:**  
- Assignment of students/mentors to projects  

**Objective:**  
Optimize group compositions and workload.

### Challenge Problem 2 – Beethoven

**Context:**  
Project Beethoven aims to stimulate the semiconductor industry and increase MSc student numbers.

**Goal:**  
Attract more MSc students by changing the curriculum and advertising strategies.

**Input:**
- List of potential courses + costs  
- List of students with interests  

**Output:**
- Collection of course tracks  
- Selection of students to attract  

**Objective:**  
Minimize total course and advertising costs.

## Academic Dishonesty

Students must work independently in their groups.  
- Discussion of material and general strategies is fine.  
- **Copying or using others’ work (including online sources) is prohibited.**  
- Solving problems yourself is critical for learning.  
- Representing others’ work as your own = **fraud** and will be dealt with accordingly.

## ChatGPT Policy

> “Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the expectation is for you to work independently and formulate and write up your own solutions without outside help.  
> While ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for understanding, using it to directly solve problems for this course would not be considered independent work.  
> Therefore, it is best to refrain from using ChatGPT to directly solve problems for this course.”
